Quick Start
===========
Prerequisites
-------------
If you are reading this quick start guide, it is assumed that you have an active Questrade trading account with which to use the API. If this is not the case, then I don't know what you are doing here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

Setup
-----
In order to acces Questrade's API, you need to authorize your application to use the API through your account. This can be done by following `this guide <https://www.questrade.com/api/documentation/getting-started>`__ from Questrade.
Once this is done, you should be able to generate refresh tokens. This is important because you will need to feed one of those token to the Session in order to be able to perform API calls.
